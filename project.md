# Requirement

## 1. Project Overview

### 2.5 Code Generation
- **2.5.1** Generate Python code for the Strands Agent SDK based on the visual flow.
- **2.5.2** Provide real-time code preview as the flow is modified.
- **2.5.3** Support syntax highlighting for the generated code.
- **2.5.4** Allow users to manually edit the generated code with bidirectional updates (changes in code reflect in UI and vice versa).

### 2.6 Project Management
- **2.6.1** Allow users to save, load, and manage agent projects.
- **2.6.2** Provide import/export functionality for agent configurations.
- **2.6.3** Support version control for agent definitions.

### 2.7 Execution and Testing
- **2.7.1** Allow users to test the agent within the web interface.
- **2.7.2** Provide execution logs and debugging information.
- **2.7.3** Support deployment of the agent to the backend server.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Frontend
