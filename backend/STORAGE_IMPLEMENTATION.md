# File Storage System Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive file storage system for the Strands UI backend as requested. The system provides secure, organized storage for project artifacts including generated code, flow definitions, execution results, and metadata.

## Architecture

### Components Implemented

1. **Data Models** (`app/models/storage.py`)
   - `StorageMetadata`: Core metadata for stored artifacts
   - `ArtifactRequest/Response`: API request/response models
   - `ProjectInfo/VersionInfo/ExecutionInfo`: Hierarchical information models
   - `StorageStats`: System statistics model
   - `ArtifactContent`: Content retrieval model

2. **Storage Service** (`app/services/storage_service.py`)
   - `StorageService`: Main service class with async file operations
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations for artifacts
   - Project/version/execution management
   - Statistical analysis capabilities
   - Error handling and path validation

3. **Utility Functions** (`app/utils/path_utils.py`)
   - Path sanitization for security
   - Safe directory creation
   - Checksum calculation (SHA256)
   - File type validation

4. **Exception Handling** (`app/utils/exceptions.py`)
   - Custom exception hierarchy
   - Detailed error types for different failure modes

5. **API Endpoints** (integrated into `main.py`)
   - RESTful API for all storage operations
   - File serving capabilities
   - Comprehensive error handling

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Save artifacts (generate.py, flow.json, result.json, metadata.json)
- ✅ Retrieve artifacts by project/version/execution
- ✅ List projects and versions
- ✅ Storage cleanup and management
- ✅ File serving endpoints
- ✅ Storage statistics

### Security Features
- ✅ Path sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ Safe path checking
- ✅ Input validation with Pydantic

### Performance Features
- ✅ Async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Efficient file operations with aiofiles
- ✅ Metadata caching
- ✅ Checksum verification

## API Endpoints

### Artifact Management
- `POST /api/storage/artifacts` - Save an artifact
- `GET /api/storage/artifacts/{project_id}/{version}/{execution_id}/{file_type}` - Retrieve artifact content
- `GET /api/storage/artifacts/{project_id}/{version}/{execution_id}/{file_type}/download` - Download artifact file
- `DELETE /api/storage/artifacts/{project_id}/{version}/{execution_id}/{file_type}` - Delete an artifact

### Project Management
- `GET /api/storage/projects` - List all projects
- `GET /api/storage/projects/{project_id}/versions` - Get project versions
- `GET /api/storage/projects/{project_id}/versions/{version}/executions/{execution_id}` - Get execution info

### System Information
- `GET /api/storage/stats` - Get storage system statistics

## Storage Structure

```
storage/
├── {project_id}/
│   ├── {version}/
│   │   ├── {execution_id}/
│   │   │   ├── generate.py
│   │   │   ├── generate.py.metadata.json
│   │   │   ├── flow.json  
│   │   │   ├── flow.json.metadata.json
│   │   │   ├── result.json
│   │   │   ├── result.json.metadata.json
│   │   │   ├── metadata.json
│   │   │   └── metadata.json.metadata.json
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests (`test_storage_system.py`) that verify:
- Path utility functions
- Storage service operations
- Error handling
- API endpoints
- File integrity with checksums

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating the robustness of the implementation.

## Example Usage

### Save an Artifact
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/storage/artifacts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "my-project",
    "version": "1.0.0", 
    "execution_id": "exec-123",
    "content": "print(\"Hello World\")",
    "file_type": "generate.py"
  }'
```

### Retrieve an Artifact
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/storage/artifacts/my-project/1.0.0/exec-123/generate.py"
```

### Get Storage Statistics
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/storage/stats"
```

## Integration with Existing Backend

The storage system has been seamlessly integrated with the existing FastAPI backend:
- Preserves all existing functionality
- Uses consistent logging patterns
- Follows existing code structure
- Maintains async/await patterns
- Uses the same error handling approach

## Next Steps

The storage system is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for:
1. Integration with the frontend UI
2. Addition of more artifact types as needed
3. Implementation of backup/restore functionality
4. Addition of compression for large files
5. Implementation of retention policies

The implementation successfully fulfills all the requirements specified in the original request.
