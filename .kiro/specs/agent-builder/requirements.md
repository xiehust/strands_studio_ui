# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to visually create and configure agents using the Strands Agent SDK through a drag-and-drop interface built with React Flow. The system consists of a React frontend for visual editing and a FastAPI backend for Python code generation and execution. Users can design agent workflows by connecting different nodes representing agent components, configure their properties, and run the resulting agents locally for testing and development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to drag and drop agent components onto a canvas, so that I can visually design agent workflows without writing code manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the agent builder THEN the system SHALL display a canvas area and a component palette
2. WHEN the user drags a component from the palette THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator of the drag operation
3. WHEN the user drops a component onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL create a new node representing that component
4. WHEN the user drops a component outside the canvas area THEN the system SHALL cancel the drop operation
5. IF the canvas has existing nodes THEN the system SHALL position new nodes to avoid overlapping

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect agent components with visual connections, so that I can define the flow of data and control between components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over a node output port THEN the system SHALL highlight available connection points
2. WHEN the user drags from an output port to an input port THEN the system SHALL create a connection between the nodes
3. WHEN the user attempts to connect incompatible ports THEN the system SHALL prevent the connection and show an error indicator
4. WHEN the user clicks on an existing connection THEN the system SHALL allow deletion of that connection
5. IF a connection would create a circular dependency THEN the system SHALL prevent the connection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure properties of agent components, so that I can customize their behavior for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL display a properties panel for that component
2. WHEN the user modifies a property value THEN the system SHALL validate the input and update the node configuration
3. WHEN the user enters invalid property values THEN the system SHALL show validation errors and prevent saving
4. WHEN the user saves property changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation of the node if needed
5. IF a property change affects connections THEN the system SHALL validate and update connection compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate Strands Agent SDK code from my visual design, so that I can use the agent in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Generate Code" button THEN the frontend SHALL send the workflow to the FastAPI backend for code generation
2. WHEN the backend processes the workflow THEN it SHALL convert the visual workflow to valid Python Strands Agent SDK code
3. WHEN the generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated code in a code editor with Python syntax highlighting
4. WHEN the workflow has validation errors THEN the backend SHALL return error messages and the frontend SHALL prevent code generation
5. WHEN the user modifies the generated code THEN the system SHALL allow editing with Python syntax highlighting and validation
6. IF the workflow is empty THEN the system SHALL show a message indicating no code can be generated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run my agent locally for testing, so that I can verify it works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Run Agent" button THEN the frontend SHALL send the generated code to the FastAPI backend for execution
2. WHEN the backend receives the execution request THEN it SHALL create a Python process to run the agent using the Strands Agent SDK
3. WHEN the agent is running THEN the backend SHALL stream real-time execution status and logs to the frontend via WebSocket
4. WHEN the agent encounters an error THEN the backend SHALL capture error details and the frontend SHALL display them while stopping execution
5. WHEN the user stops the agent THEN the frontend SHALL send a stop request and the backend SHALL terminate the Python process and clean up resources
6. IF the agent requires external dependencies THEN the backend SHALL check for availability in the Python environment and return missing requirements to the frontend

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to save and load agent workflows, so that I can persist my work and share designs with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Save Workflow" THEN the frontend SHALL send the current workflow to the FastAPI backend for persistence
2. WHEN the user provides a filename THEN the backend SHALL serialize and save the workflow in JSON format with that name
3. WHEN the user clicks "Load Workflow" THEN the frontend SHALL request available workflows from the backend and display them
4. WHEN the user selects a workflow to load THEN the backend SHALL return the workflow data and the frontend SHALL restore the canvas to that workflow state
5. IF a workflow file is corrupted THEN the backend SHALL return an error message and the frontend SHALL show it without modifying the current canvas

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see available Strands Agent SDK components in a organized palette, so that I can easily find and use the components I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the frontend SHALL request available Strands Agent SDK components from the FastAPI backend and display them in a component palette
2. WHEN the backend discovers components THEN it SHALL introspect the Strands SDK installation and return component metadata organized by category
3. WHEN the user searches for a component THEN the frontend SHALL filter the palette to show matching components
4. WHEN the user hovers over a component in the palette THEN the frontend SHALL show a tooltip with component description retrieved from the backend
5. IF new Strands Agent SDK components are available THEN the backend SHALL dynamically discover them and the frontend SHALL update the palette

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend service to manage Python environments and dependencies, so that I can run agents without manual Python setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the FastAPI backend SHALL verify the Strands Agent SDK installation and required dependencies
2. WHEN a workflow requires specific tools or models THEN the backend SHALL check for their availability in the Python environment
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the backend SHALL provide clear error messages with installation instructions
4. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL create isolated Python environments for agent execution to prevent conflicts
5. IF the Python environment becomes corrupted THEN the backend SHALL provide recovery mechanisms and error reporting
